## Assignment Set Up

* Complete all the exercises as described inside each assignment file.
* To test your `console.log()` statements, open up the index.html file found in the assignments folder and use the developer tools to view the console.  

## The `this` keyword

Having a solid understanding of how `this` works will give you a huge advantage when you start building with more advanced frameworks. Use the [this.js](assignments/this.js) file to traverse through a few `this` problems.

## Prototype

The prototype challenge will focus on building prototypes for a fantasy themed game that includes mages, swordsmen, and archers.  Follow the [prototypes.js](assignments/this.js) instructions closely to create the beginnings of what could be an awesome JavaScript game.

* Read the instructions found within the file carefully to finish the challenges. 
* Remember to un-comment the objects and console logs to test your work at the bottom of the page.
